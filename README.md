        <h2>Fighting Against Disinformation</h2>
        <p>In today's digital world, disinformation spreads rapidly, affecting individuals, communities, and even nations. False or misleading information can shape public opinion, manipulate emotions, and cause real-world harm. To combat disinformation, we must be proactive, critical, and well-informed.</p>
        
        <h3>Understanding Disinformation</h3>
        <p>Disinformation is the deliberate spread of false information with the intent to deceive. Unlike misinformation, which may be shared unknowingly, disinformation is crafted to manipulate people’s beliefs or actions. It thrives on social media, news outlets, and even casual conversations.</p>
        
        <h3>How to Fight Back</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Verify Sources:</strong> Always check the credibility of the source before believing or sharing information. Reliable news comes from established, fact-based media organizations.</li>
            <li><strong>Think Before You Share:</strong> Disinformation spreads because people share it impulsively. Before hitting “share,” take a moment to fact-check.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Fact-Checking Tools:</strong> Platforms like Snopes, FactCheck.org, and government fact-checking sites can help determine the truth.</li>
            <li><strong>Educate Others:</strong> Encourage media literacy in your community. The more people understand how disinformation works, the harder it is for false narratives to take hold.</li>
            <li><strong>Report False Content:</strong> Many social media platforms allow users to report misleading or harmful content.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Fighting disinformation is a collective effort. By staying informed, questioning sources, and promoting factual information, we can slow the spread of fake news and misinformation. Truth is a powerful tool—let’s use it wisely.</p>
